## "Visualization-Aided ML Preprocessor in CLI"
This project focuses on building a CLI-based machine learning preprocessor with integrated data visualization capabilities. By offering real-time visual feedback, the tool aims to streamline data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering tasks, enhancing data quality and model performance.

## About
Visualization-Aided ML Preprocessor in CLI is designed to transform data preprocessing into an interactive, visualization-driven process. Traditional CLI preprocessing tools often lack intuitive visual insights, making it challenging to identify issues like outliers, distribution imbalances, and missing values. This tool overcomes these challenges by incorporating visualization modules directly into the CLI, offering real-time insights to data scientists and ML practitioners during data preparation.

## Features
-Integrates advanced data preprocessing techniques with visualization.

-Modular CLI framework, supporting extensions for future functionalities.

-Efficient data handling with minimal memory and time complexity.

-Real-time visual feedback for data insights such as distributions, correlations, and outliers.

-JSON-based configurable settings for customization and scalability.

## Requirements
Operating System: 64-bit OS (Windows 10, Ubuntu) for compatibility with visualization and ML libraries.

Development Environment: Python 3.8 or later to support modern libraries and CLI functionalities.

Data Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn for generating in-CLI visualizations.

Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn for preprocessing functions and model evaluation.

Data Handling Libraries: Pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation.

Version Control: Git for collaborative development and version management.

IDE: VSCode for streamlined coding, debugging, and CLI testing.

Additional Dependencies:

click for building CLI interfaces.

tqdm for progress bars.

json for configuration management and data handling in customizable formats.

This setup ensures an efficient, interactive CLI tool that enhances preprocessing and visualization workflows, providing valuable insights into data before model training.
